A cute little script I made wrapping Entrez tools to download data from NCBI.

This script works well for basic downloading functions and is geared towards users with minimal knowledge of python who may not feel comfortable using Biopython's Entrez tools natively.

NOTE: This script works with python3 as of 2/28/2020.
